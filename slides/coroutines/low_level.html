    <h5>Callback Abstraction</h5>
    <p>
        At the low level coroutines can be seen as blocks of sequential(synchronous) code
        separated by suspension points(suspending functions) with the next block of code
        being passed as continuation(a callback).
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result we can write asynchronous code as if it was synchronous.
