    <h5>Suspending Convention</h5>
    <p class="fragment">Every function that is declared as extension on CoroutineScope returns immediately, but performs its actions concurrently with the rest of the program.</p>
    <p class="fragment">Suspending functions can and should wait for all their work to complete before returning to the caller.</p>
